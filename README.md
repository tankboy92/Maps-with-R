# Maps-with-R

This notebook demonstrates how to create maps in R using the maps and mapproj packages.

## Installation
First, we need to install the necessary packages. This is done using the install.packages function.

## Importing Libraries
Next, we import the necessary libraries. This includes readr for reading data, tidyverse for data manipulation and visualization, maps for creating geographical maps, and mapproj for map projections.

## Importing Data
We then import the data for US states using the map_data function from the maps package.


## Plotting the Map
We create a basic plot of the US states using ggplot and geom_polygon.


## Map Projection
We then apply the Albers projection to the map using the coord_map function.


## Subsetting Data
Finally, we subset the data for the state of Georgia using the subset function.


This notebook provides a basic introduction to creating maps in R. For more complex visualizations, additional data and customization may be required.
